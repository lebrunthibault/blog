# Basics

## Install

- Use pipenv
- Nesting can be removed
- Use .env with [django-environ](https://github.com/joke2k/django-environ)
- [django debug toolbar](https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) like in symfony



## Structure

- Project == site: app == service. project many to many app
- apps can live anywhere in the python path





## Routing

- Each app can define routes in a URLconf file
- The routing file is included in the main site routing URLconf
- `include` chops off matched url part and sends to included for further processing
- Patterns donâ€™t search GET and POST parameters, or the domain name
- Route has url, route name, view (HttpRequest handler) + kwargs. Like in Symfony



## Django ORM

- Model classes



## Logging

- [django and python logging](https://djangodeconstructed.com/2018/12/18/django-and-python-logging-in-plain-english/)
- [django-logging-right-way/](https://lincolnloop.com/blog/django-logging-right-way/) : hands on django logging config includes sentry
- Override django default logging : **Best** 



## Testing



#### Debugger

- Straightforward when running python scripts
- Using django server run configuration (see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFuaU3Sl4-c))



# Difference django / symfony

- django lighter and more options for views
- system of apps

#### Orm

- saving directly on the entitiy
- not great: magical methods in django (e.g. backward one to many, always use default args)
- app should be added to the installed apps
- better handling of choices / enum  in django (integrated to the model field definition)
- relations
  - one to many : [`ForeignKey`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ForeignKey) on the owning side
  - many to many : [`ManyToManyField`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ManyToManyField) 
  - one to one : [`OneToOneField`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.OneToOneField)
