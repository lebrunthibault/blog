## Previous Special Reports

- an IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the **threat of climate change**, **sustainable development**, and **efforts to eradicate poverty** (2018)
-  Climate Change and Land: an IPCC Special Report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (2019)
- IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (2019)

## B. Recent developments and current trends

-  Average annual GHG emissions during 2010-2019 were higher than in any previous decade
  - it is the highest increase in average decadal emissions on record
-  but the rate of growth between 2010 and 2019 was lower than that between 2000 and 2009
  - The average annual rate of growth slowed from 2.1% yr-1 between 2000 and 2009 to 1.3% yr-1 between 2010 and 2019
- net anthropogenic GHG : in 2019 12% higher than 2010 and 54% higher than 1990
- 42% of historical cumulative net CO2 emissions happened between 1990 and 2019
- All gases have increased. The highest relative growth occurred in **fluorinated gases**,

### Carbon budget

- GHG emissions 2010 - 2019 : 400 Gt
- from 2020 onwards for limiting warming to **1.5°C** with a probability of 50% has been assessed as **500 Gt** CO2 (4/5 of last decade)
- **1150 Gt** CO2 for a probability of 67% for limiting warming to **2°C** (1/3 of last decade)
- Remaining carbon budgets depend on the amount of non-CO2 mitigation (±220 Gt CO2) and are further subject to geophysical uncertainties

## B2 : Sectors

- Net anthropogenic GHG emissions have increased since 2010 across all major sectors globall
- . An increasing share of emissions can be attributed to urban areas. Emissions reductions in CO2 from fossil fuels and industrial processes, due to improvements in **energy intensity of GDP** and **carbon intensity of energy**, have been less than emissions increases from rising global activity levels in industry, energy supply, transport, agriculture and buildings
- In 2019 emissions by sector :
  - 34% : energy supply (12% if we reattribute energy supply)
  - 24% : industry (34% if we attribute energy supply)
  - 22% : agriculture, forestry and other land use
  - 15% : transport
  - 6% : building (16% if we attribute energy supply)

### Growth evolution

- diminution : Energy supply, industry
- constant : transport sector

### B2.3 : Cities

- The global share of emissions that can be attributed to urban areas is increasing
-  In 2015, urban emissions were estimated to be 25 GtCO2-eq (about 62% of the global share) and in 2020, 29 GtCO2- eq (67-72% of the global share)

### B2.4 : energy intensity

- Global energy intensity (total primary energy per unit GDP) decreased by 2% yr-1 between 2010 and 2019.
- Carbon intensity (CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes (CO2 FFI) per unit primary energy) decreased by 0.3% yr-1

## B3 : Regional contributions

- The 10% of households with the highest per capita emissions contribute a disproportionately large share of global household GHG emissions
- At least 18 countries have sustained GHG emission reductions for longer than 10 years
- Average global per capita net anthropogenic GHG emissions increased from 7.7 to 7.8 tCO2-eq, ranging from 2.6 tCO2-eq to 19 tCO2-eq across regions.
- In 2019, LDCs (Least developed countries) are estimated to have emitted 3.3% of global GHG emissions, excluding CO2-LULUCF
